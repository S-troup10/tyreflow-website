# MISSING IMAGES - For TyreFlow Website

## Status
Currently using `biketyre.jpeg` for all decorative elements.  
Three additional images are referenced in the design but not yet in the repository.

## Required Images
1. `Mountain_bike_tyre_design_render_7f2bb73d4b.jpeg`
2. `Mountain_bike_tyre_design_render_f3efe22e9d.jpeg`
3. `Mountain_bike_wheel_side_view_c5c1b5a5ac.jpeg`

## Source
These images are currently in a Google Drive folder (not accessible via direct download).

## Action Required
Please add these three images to the GitHub repository:
1. Download from Google Drive
2. Add to the repository root (`tyreflow-website/` folder)
3. Commit and push

## Current Workaround
All decorative tyre elements currently use `biketyre.jpeg` as a fallback.  
This provides visual consistency but limits variety.

## Impact
- Visual variety reduced (all tyres look identical)
- Design still functional and premium
- No broken images
